    # 1. Model Selection: We chose a LightGBM Classifier ('LGBMClassifier')
    # for this task. The key reasons for this choice are:
    #   - Performance: LightGBM is a gradient boosting model known for its
    #     state-of-the-art accuracy on tabular data like ours.
    #   - Speed: It's highly optimized for speed and memory efficiency, making
    #     it suitable for large datasets.
    #   - Robustness: It can handle a mix of feature types and is less prone
    #     to overfitting with proper tuning.

    # and LightGBM expect a 2D array or DataFrame as input.
